<h1>Blazor & Elastic Beanstalk Frontend</h1>

<p>We are using Blazor (which utilizes C# and HTML) to host an application via Elastic Beanstalk</p>

#Release Notes
<p>Currently our Blazor app can connect to the AWS SQL Server I have setup, locally, and grab information from the database tables I have provided.
The simple functionality I have put in the app is given a course name as a string in a text box, I will return the information for that course in an html table format.</p>
